    <h1>Why NWR Was Born</h1>
    <p>In a world where each unit of currency is printed as debt, we plant NWR as a seed of freedom. A movement to unchain the human spirit from the weight of interest, banks, and scarcity. Born not from greed, but from the earth’s rhythm and people’s love.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="problem">
    <h2>The Real Problem with Currency</h2>
    <p>Every time a dollar is printed, a debt is born. Every transaction feeds a cycle of repayment. But who was the lender of the air? The water? Why must we pay interest on life itself? This is not wealth — it is control.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="harmony">
    <h2>Harmony with Nature</h2>
    <p>Nature doesn’t charge interest. The rain falls without invoice. The tree does not demand a loan agreement to offer shade. NWR reflects that — token flow like water, not debt. Contribution is growth, not extraction.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="nwr-tokens">
    <h2>🌍 NWR: A Debt-Free Society in Nine Tokens</h2>

  </section>

  <section id="birthright">
    <h2>Your Right to Earth's Resources</h2>
    <p>You were born with a claim to this planet. Not to hoard it, but to share it. We believe every human being has the right to food, shelter, clean air, access to knowledge and tools — and to be rewarded for their care, creativity, and courage.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="vendor">
    <h2>🌱 Debt-Free Vendor Initiative</h2>
    <p><em>“Join the Circle, Issue the Card, Uplift the human, nature as community”</em></p>
    <p>All vendors are welcome to join our global movement and issue the Debt-Free Card — a symbol of purpose, dignity, and shared wealth.</p>
    <h3>💳 What is the Debt-Free Card?</h3>
    <p>A vendor-backed card that lets customers earn NWR5 tokens every time they make a purchase. This isn’t cashback. It’s giveback. A ripple of goodwill. A spark of change.</p>
    <h3>💚 Vendor Contribution: Just 1% — or More if You Wish</h3>
    <p>Every vendor chooses how much of their earnings they’d like to set aside — starting from just 1% — to support the growth of a debt-free society. This contribution funds:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Customer token rewards (NWR5)</li>
      <li>Local DAO hubs and wellness centers</li>
      <li>Educational programs on financial freedom</li>
      <li>Earth-honoring projects</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>🔁 Circulation, Not Extraction</h3>
    <p>Instead of money flowing up to banks and debt holders, it flows out — to nourish people, community, and planet. Just like the rain returns to the sea.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>🔧 How It Works (Simplified Flow):</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Vendor joins the NWR system (via dApp or Telegram)</li>
      <li>Selects contribution % (e.g. 1% of daily or weekly sales)</li>
      <li>System automatically issues NWR5 to customers (via smart contract or wallet interface)</li>
      <li>Customer can use NWR5 for:
        <ul>
          <li>DAO participation</li>
          <li>Discounts or partner stores</li>
          <li>Daily reward claims</li>
          <li>Voting on local community support</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <h3>🌍 Together, We Rise</h3>
    <p>This is more than a loyalty system. It’s a philosophy. Vendors become patrons of freedom. Buyers become stewards of value. Everyone becomes a participant in a better world.</p>
