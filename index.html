    <h1>Why NWR Was Born</h1>
    <p>In a world where each unit of currency is printed as debt, we plant NWR as a seed of freedom. A movement to unchain the human spirit from the weight of interest, banks, and scarcity. Born not from greed, but from the earth’s rhythm and people’s love.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="problem">
    <h2>The Real Problem with Currency</h2>
    <p>Every time a dollar is printed, a debt is born. Every transaction feeds a cycle of repayment. But who was the lender of the air? The water? Why must we pay interest on life itself? This is not wealth — it is control.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="harmony">
    <h2>Harmony with Nature</h2>
    <p>Nature doesn’t charge interest. The rain falls without invoice. The tree does not demand a loan agreement to offer shade. NWR reflects that — token flow like water, not debt. Contribution is growth, not extraction.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="nwr-tokens">
    <h2>🌍 NWR: A Debt-Free Society in Nine Tokens</h2>
    <h3>🔨 5th to 1st — The Road Paved</h3>
    <p>These are the foundation stones, the builders of the new earth. They lay the path, break the chains, and prepare hearts for harmony.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>5. NWR5 — Noorelah Wage Rights</strong><br>Where contribution is honored. Every token earned with dignity, not borrowed with burden.</li>
      <li><strong>4. NWR4 — New Wisdom Rise</strong><br>Ancient truths made new again. Knowledge is shared, not sold. We rise, together, with wisdom in hand.</li>
      <li><strong>3. NWR3 — Now We Reflect</strong><br>A mirror to what was and what must never be again. We learn. We pause. We see.</li>
      <li><strong>2. NWR2 — Nurture With Respect</strong><br>People, Nature, Community — The holy trinity of balance. We care, without cost.</li>
      <li><strong>1. NWR1 — Nature Within Reach</strong><br>The root. The breath of life. Our beginning is not forgotten — it is reclaimed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>🛤️ These five pave the road. They clear the debt. They make way for what’s coming next.</p>

    <h3>👑 6th to 9th — The Reign and Design</h3>
    <p>These tokens don’t build the road — they walk it. They shape the structures, design the sky, and rule with reverence.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>6. NWR6 — Network With Responsibility (Coming Soon)</strong><br>A connected world without exploitation. Nodes of trust. Threads of accountability. A net that uplifts, not ensnares.</li>
      <li><strong>7. NWR7 — Navigate With Resilience (Coming Soon)</strong><br>We no longer drift. We steer with soul, adapting without abandoning who we are.</li>
      <li><strong>8. NWR8 — Nourish With Reverence (Coming Soon)</strong><br>We don't consume — we cherish. Value is sacred. Growth is mindful.</li>
      <li><strong>9. NWR9 — Nirvana With Reciprocity (Coming Soon)</strong><br>The circle closes — not with endings, but with exchange. What we give returns. What we receive, we pass on.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>🌾 These four reign not with control, but with creativity. They design the culture, govern with vision, and keep the garden thriving.</p>

    <h3>♻️ NWR: A Full Circle of Freedom</h3>
    <p>“The first five cleanse the soil. The last four plant the forest.”<br>A society where value flows without debt, contribution is honored, and nature and people thrive as one.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="birthright">
    <h2>Your Right to Earth's Resources</h2>
    <p>You were born with a claim to this planet. Not to hoard it, but to share it. We believe every human being has the right to food, shelter, clean air, access to knowledge and tools — and to be rewarded for their care, creativity, and courage.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="vendor">
  <h2>🌱 Debt-Free Vendor Initiative</h2>
  <p><em>“Join the Circle, Issue the Card, Uplift the human, nature as community”</em></p>
  <p>All vendors are welcome to join our global movement and issue the <strong>Debt-Free Card</strong> — a symbol of purpose, dignity, and shared wealth.</p>

  <h3>💳 What is the Debt-Free Card?</h3>
  <p>A vendor-backed card that lets customers earn NWR5 tokens every time they make a purchase.<br>
  This isn’t cashback.<br>
  It’s <strong>giveback</strong>.<br>
  A ripple of goodwill. A spark of change.</p>

  <h3>💚 Vendor Contribution: Just 1% — or More if You Wish</h3>
  <p>Every vendor chooses how much of their earnings they’d like to set aside — starting from just 1% — to support the growth of a debt-free society.</p>

  <p>This contribution funds:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Customer token rewards (NWR5)</li>
    <li>Local DAO hubs and wellness centers</li>
    <li>Educational programs on financial freedom</li>
    <li>Earth-honoring projects</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🔁 Circulation, Not Extraction</h3>
  <p>Instead of money flowing up to banks and debt holders, it flows out — to nourish people, community, and planet. Just like the rain returns to the sea.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>🔧 How It Works (Simplified Flow):</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Vendor joins the NWR system (via dApp or Telegram)</li>
    <li>Selects contribution % (e.g. 1% of daily or weekly sales)</li>
    <li>System automatically issues NWR5 to customers (via smart contract or wallet interface)</li>
    <li>Customer can use NWR5 for:
      <ul>
        <li>DAO participation</li>
        <li>Discounts or partner stores</li>
        <li>Daily reward claims</li>
        <li>Voting on local community support</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <hr>

  <h3>🌍 Together, We Rise</h3>
  <p>This is more than a loyalty system. It’s a philosophy.</p>
  <p>Vendors become <strong>patrons of freedom</strong>.<br>
  Buyers become <strong>stewards of value</strong>.<br>
  Everyone becomes a <strong>participant in a better world</strong>.</p>
